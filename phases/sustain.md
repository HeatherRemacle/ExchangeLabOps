#Sustain the Team and Product

During this phase, the team and product are healthy enough that the focused attention of the Lab Operations team is directed to the broader organization to support sustainment.

#### Pre-conditions
- The beta product has been released to people using the service.
- The roadmap indicates a diminishing backlog of features to refine as the product moves into a "Live" and continuously improving state.

#### What Success Looks Like in this phase
- The organization now has a high functioning Agile Delivery Team that is appropriately resourced with internal talent.
- The product is meeting user and stakeholder expectations and can be brought to the Minister's awareness.
- The Executive Sponsors and Alliance team and governance

## Continuous Product Improvement
In this play, a team is responsible for the continuous cycle of product enhancement and ongoing support, based on incorporating user feedback and operational metrics provided by monitoring. Continuous product improvement is a critical aspect of product management; it is aimed at improving work practices that focus on customer value adding tasks and minimizing non-value (defect remediation, partially done work, unnecessary features) activities.  

The work undertaken to this point offers insights and metrics that should be reviewed and actioned as part of the overall improvement and change management processes.
