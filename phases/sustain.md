During this phase, the team and product are healthy enough that the focused attention of the Lab Operations team is directed to the broader organization to support sustainment.

#### Pre-conditions
- The beta product has been released to people using the service.
- The roadmap indicates a diminishing backlog of features to refine as the product moves into a "Live" and continuously improving state.

#### What Success Looks Like in this phase
- The organization now has a high functioning Agile Delivery Team that is appropriately resourced with internal talent.
- The product is meeting user and stakeholder expectations and can be brought to the Minister's awareness.
- The Executive Sponsors and Alliance team and governance

## Adopt Continuous Product Improvement
Continuous product improvement is a critical aspect of product management. We are shifting away from approaches where service products are built and procured as though they are final (i.e. a project with a fixed scope), or do not need to adapt to evolving user needs. The BC Public Service is improving policies and processes related to funding and organization design to support the adoption of continuous improvement for products.

As best we can, We work with various parts of home Ministries to get them to a state where they can support and sustain a team and their product. This includes:

- IM/IT agencies (known as information management or systems branches)
- Project Management Offices
- Corporate Service Shops
- Strategic human resources
- Program/business area leadership teams (managers and directors)

Over the last few years, the Lab team has learned how critical it is to bring these and other parts of the organizations along on the learning journey (we haven't succeeded at this every time). While specialists in privacy, security, architecture, human resource management, finance and project management might not have the benefit of deep learning the product team has, they must have opportunities to see how these teams operate and what they need.
