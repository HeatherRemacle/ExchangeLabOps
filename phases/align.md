# Align Your Organization

During this phase, people who will participate in contributing to results are brought together to align to the problem and the approach to solving it.

The Exchange Lab has experience assessing the context within an organization that might enable or disable success.

#### What Success Looks Like in this phase
- The people (stakeholders) inside the organization who will be responsible, accountable or implicated in the service delivery changes associated with the product are engaged.
- There is a sense of what key stakeholders need to be able to accept and/or adopt digital approaches.
- There is a commitment to make it work, and a plan to bring people along.
