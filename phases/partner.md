Is your service delivery program ready to apply the Digital Principles and mindset and methods of Agile product development?

Programs that partner with the Exchange Lab demonstrate a **need for acceleration** towards this new way of working and they are **ready for the challenge.**

Prior to partnering with the Exchange, a program area must demonstrate they are:

- **Solving a real problem:** Enough service analytics and/or user research has confirmed the users needs requires development of a new product.
- **Priority for the Ministry:** receives funding, requires timely delivery, is connected to mandate, and generally has the attention of the senior executive.
- **Complex:** requires focused attention to define the problem and explore and test solutions using Agile methods.
- **Digital:** requires a digital or online expression (this may also lead to policy and procedure changes) or advances broader government digital objectives.
- **Broadly valued:** includes at least one business capability that serves the needs of other program areas, such that the product built can be leveraged by others.
- **Continuous:** will deliver value into the foreseeable future, such that a program will dedicate a team to continuously improve the product after it leaves the Lab.
