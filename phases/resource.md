## Ready, Refine, Sprint...
Activities undertaken by the entire team to define a fulsome “Sprint 0”  prepare the team for product development sprints.  

Adopt code frameworks and libraries that accelerate your development to create a working Minimal Viable Product (MVP) solutions that adheres to security and privacy requirements.

Define your architecturally significant requirements (ASR) based on product abilities.

### Step 1: Develop a Release Plan 
-	Refine the (initial) backlog
-	Define the product release schedule
-	Develop/review feature stories
-	Identify dependencies

### Step 2: Develop Your Conceptual Architecture
- Document the overarching view of the system and placement of technical functions (e.g. use modeling tools to visualize relationships)
- Whiteboard relationships between components and the data model

### Step 3: Adhere to Modern Application Principles
-	Adopt the [12 factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve-Factor_App_methodology){:target="_blank"} approach
-	Understand cloud-native architecture

### Step 4: Set up Your Technical Infrastructure
- Establish communication channels for support
    - MS-Teams, RocketChat, Slack
- Create a documentation repository
- Provision your environments
- Verify access

### Step 5: Identify Your Development Workflow Processes
-	Analyze your workflow
-	Identify key processes and break them down 
- Look for opportunities to Automate

### Step 6: Set Up, Document, and Implement Your Tooling (Code Repository, Pipelines, Automation)
Verify your  processes for successful:
- Integration
- Build and Deployment
- Application Security

### Step 7: Educate Your Business Stakeholders
Your project has a finite set of resources and funding; defining and managing the scope is critical to your team’s success. The product owner educates both the team and the stakeholders in order to manage the team’s velocity and output.
-	Keep an eye on the budget
-	Ensure change management processes are being followed
-	Regularly prune the backlog(s)

### Step 8: Now Sprint...
- Following a successful “Sprint 0” phase, your team is prepared to start coding, testing, and committing features into the source code management system

### Step 9: Monitor and Measure the Development Process
-	Is the rate (velocity) of development keeping up with expectations?
-	[Monitor your system for reliability](https://aspetraining.com/resources/blog/system-monitoring-age-of-site-reliability-engineering){:target="_blank"}

### Step 10: Conduct Code Reviews (As Required)
-	Automate where possible

### Step 11: Complete User Acceptance Testing and Remediate Defects
- Being agile means user acceptance testing is happening all the time
- Dealing with this often will save effort and time in the future

### Step 12: Deploy and Promote Through Your Environments
- The Product Owner (PO) confirms the [Definition of Done](https://www.scrum.org/forum/scrum-forum/5438/product-owner-and-definition-done){:target="_blank"} (DoD) prior to deployment

### Step 13: Demonstrate Your Products Frequently and Obtain User Feedback  
- Sprint demo (feature delivery)
- Stakeholder demo (batch delivery)

### Definition of an MVP
A Minimal Viable Product (MVP) is one that delivers core functionality as expected by a business unit's target audience. The core functionality is a set of features that is delivered at the initial product  launch. Once launched, the product follows a documented lifecycle for user feedback and product support.

An MVP is no longer considered to be an experiment, but a product that has value to its users.

### Guidance to Consider
-	Understand how product management is different in Agile projects
-	Understand Agile software product integrity
-	Define and develop your pipeline (ex: Jenkins)
-	Create and maintain a testing framework
