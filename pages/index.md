We are known as a **lab** and a **community** of people who are learning how to improve service delivery in the BC Public Service.

We are also the home of the [BC Developers' Exchange](https://bcdevexchange.org/), known for producing innovative procurement tools ([Code with Us and Sprint with Us](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/marketplace)) and **a thriving community of GovTech designers and developers.**

This website guides expectations for how The Exchange Lab operates and makes our methods and tools open for others to use.

## Our Mission
Government, through the BC Public Service, can be trusted to respond to change and meet peoples' expectations for excellent service delivery. A [modern public service](http://whereideaswork.gov.bc.ca/modern/) that embraces digital mindset and practices is one way to achieve this mission.

To  Exchange Lab partners with government programs to deliver high quality, modern services by supporting people to learn and apply the best available design and delivery methods, tools, and technology.

**The results we seek center around:**
- Creating high performing, cross functional teams.
- Delivering high value public impact through excellent digital products and services.
- Maximizing the return on public funding to modernize the public service through technology investment, policy improvement, community building and organizational development.
- Connecting an ecosystem of public service oriented people and agencies - inside the BC Government and beyond.

## Delivery Model

We apply BC's [Digital Principles](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/digital-principles/) and generally accepted modern [standards for service design and delivery](/standard), pioneered and practiced by other government digital service agencies around the world.

The Exchange Lab operates within a model of continuous improvement, centered around a value chain that delivers **teams**. Explore the phases of Exchange Lab residency and the variety of resources we produce to support teams in each phase:
1. [Apply to the Lab](https://heatherremacle.github.io/exchangelabops/apply)
2. [Align Your Org](https://heatherremacle.github.io/exchangelabops/align)
3. [Onboard & Discover](https://heatherremacle.github.io/exchangelabops/discover)
3. [Resource a Team](https://heatherremacle.github.io/exchangelabops/resource)
4. [Deliver a Product](https://heatherremacle.github.io/exchangelabops/deliver)
5. [Sustain Practices](https://heatherremacle.github.io/exchangelabops/sustain)

We continuously refine and adapt lab operations to the specific context of program areas we partner with. **There is no single, consistent path.** We operate in high degrees of complexity and create the conditions for a positive, productive trajectory through the application of:
- experimentation;
- collaboration; and
- emergent practices and standards.

## Delivery Community

**A community of people committed to learning and building public impact value together is essential to our mission.**

Guidance and playbooks can aid some of the work we do. However, conditions change so rapidly and delivery contexts are too diverse for any ordered list to remain relevant. The ever-evolving knowledge shared by the community is how we keep pace while learning how to be successful in navigating the complexity of people and technology.

The Exchange Lab is an anchor in a broader "Digital Delivery Network," which includes [experts in service improvement methods](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/experts-in-residence-tickets-109220948798) and a community of experienced "GovTech" innovators. The Team that runs the Lab supports the exchange of ideas, experience, and encouragement in this growing community through:
- online and in-person events,
- storytelling,
- learning programs, and
- online engagement platforms.
