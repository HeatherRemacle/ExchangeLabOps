Welcome to the Exhchange. We're known as a lab and a community of people who are learning how to improve service delivery from the BC Public Service together, through experimentation and collaboration. We offer services specifically designed to accellerate learning new ways of working through practice and delivery. We're contributing to the the [goal of creating a modern public service](http://whereideaswork.gov.bc.ca/modern/).

## Mission

Government can respond to change quickly and meet people's expectations for excellent service delivery. 

The Exchange partners with public service programs to deliver high quality, modern services by supporting people to learn and apply design and delivery methods, tools, and technology.

Excellent end-to-end services are enabled by partners in the Digital Delivery Network, including [experts in service improvement methods](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/experts-in-residence-tickets-109220948798) and a community of experienced "GovTech" innovators.

The results we seek center around:
- Creating high performing, cross functional teams.
- Delivering high value public impact through excellent digital products and services.
- Maximizing the return on public funding to modernize the public service through technology investment, policy improvement, and organizational development.
- Connecting an ecosystem of public service oriented people and agencies - inside the BC Government and beyond.

## Delivery Model

The Exchange Lab operates within a model of continuous improvement, centered around a value chain that delivers **teams**. Teams, as a product of this model, offer value that includes the service products they produce, as well as learning and broader organizational development.

Lab Operations are continously refined and adapted to the specific context of program areas we partner with to build teams. There is no single, consistent path, as we operate in high degrees of complexity. We create the conditions for a positive, productive trajectory through the application of: 
- research, 
- empathy, 
- deep engagement, and
- emergent best practices, including a Design and Delivery Standard.

We also center around a set of [Digital Principles.](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/digital-principles/) 

This diagram illustrates the general approach of our delivery model.

## Design and Delivery Standard

### 1: Ideate Solutions That Meet the Needs of Business
The business knows its users; it owns the problem space. Apply design thinking to new product development to create high value solutions that users want to adopt.

### 2: Successfully Navigate the Project Intake Process
Having a clear understanding of the IM/IT project governance process will ensure that your proposal obtains the necessary approvals in order to proceed.

### 7: Sustainment Lifecycle
Your product has been delivered with a roadmap that guides its lifecycle.

Review annual funding plans to account for any and all changes, including product retirement and product replacement.

## Definition of a Modern Application
A modern application is one that exhibits five important characteristics:
- It supports multiple users through the interface of their choice
  - Web, Mobile, API (application programming interface)
- It provides an API for accessing data over [HTTP(S)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS){:target="_blank"} for all features that would normally be available over a graphical user interface (GUI) or the command line interface (CLI)
- Its data is available via generic formats (such as [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON){:target="_blank"} or XML)
- It is built on a modern stack that supports the creation of an application with an HTTP interface and an API which can consume and emit JSON data
- It conforms to the relevant elements of a [12-factor](https://12factor.net/){:target="_blank"} application
