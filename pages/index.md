# Welcome to the Exchange

We're known as a **lab** and a **community** of people who are learning how to improve service delivery in the BC Public Service. We embrace experimentation and collaboration. We offer services specifically designed to accelerate learning new ways of working through practice and delivery. We're contributing to the [goal of creating a modern public service](http://whereideaswork.gov.bc.ca/modern/).

Public servants come to us to *learn and practice* Agile and service delivery innovation mindset and methods.

We are also the home of the [BC Developers' Exchange](https://bcdevexchange.org/), known for producing innovative procurement tools ([Code with Us and Sprint with Us](https://digital.gov.bc.ca/marketplace)) and a thriving community of GovTech designers and developers.

## Our Mission
Government, through the BC Public Service, can be trusted to respond to change and meet peoples' expectations for excellent service delivery.

The Exchange Lab partners with government programs to deliver high quality, modern services by supporting people to learn and apply design and delivery methods, tools, and technology.

**The results we seek center around:**
- Creating high performing, cross functional teams.
- Delivering high value public impact through excellent digital products and services.
- Maximizing the return on public funding to modernize the public service through technology investment, policy improvement, community building and organizational development.
- Connecting an ecosystem of public service oriented people and agencies - inside the BC Government and beyond.

## Delivery Model

The Exchange Lab operates within a model of continuous improvement, centered around a value chain that delivers **teams** through a period of residency. Explore the phases of Exchange Lab residency and the variety of resources we've produced to support teams in each phase:
- [Diagnose a challenge](/ExchangeLabOps/diagnose-a-challenge )
- [Align your organization](/ExchangeLabOps/align-your-org)
- [Resource a team](/ExchangeLabOps/resource-a-team)
- [Onboard and develop](/ExchangeLabOps/onboard-and-develop)
- [Deliver product](/ExchangeLabOps/delivery-a-product)
- [Sustain and improve](/ExchangeLabOps/sustain-and-improve)

We continuously refine and adapt lab operations to the specific context of program areas we partner with. **There is no single, consistent path.** We operate in high degrees of complexity and create the conditions for a positive, productive trajectory through the application of:
- active research,
- empathy,
- deep engagement, and
- emergent best practices and standards.

## Delivery Community

**A community of people who are committed to sharing learning and building and leveraging value together is essential to our mission.** While guidance and playbooks can support some amount of way finding, conditions change so rapidly and delivery contexts are too diverse for any ordered list to remain relevant. The ever-evolving knowledge shared by the community is how we keep pace while learning how to be successful in navigating the complexity of people and technology.

The Exchange Lab is an anchor in a broader "Digital Delivery Network," which includes [experts in service improvement methods](https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/experts-in-residence-tickets-109220948798) and a community of experienced "GovTech" innovators. The Team that runs the Lab supports the exchange of ideas, experience, and encouragement in this growing community through:
- online and in-person events,
- storytelling,
- learning programs, and
- online engagement platforms.

## Service Design and Delivery Standard

The Exchange community adopts generally accepted modern standards for service design and delivery that have been pioneered, practiced and proven by other government digital service agencies.

These standards are intended to guide service delivery teams to create and run great public services. This likely includes digital channels, but ultimately  should be inclusive and accessible multi-channel delivery.

As an early adopter of other service standards, we've gratefully borrowed content from the UK Service Standard and the Ontario Digital Service Standard. At this time, the Service Design and Delivery Standard we present here is intended only as a practical guide. We do envision that it will be improved and adopted for broader use, with input from those who apply it.

#### 1: Understand users and their needs
#### 2. Establish the right team
#### 3. Be consistent
#### 4. Design the service from start to finish
#### 5. Ensure users succeed the first time
#### 6. Test the end-to-end service
#### 7. Make it accessible
#### 8. Be agile and user-centred
#### 9. Use open standards and common platforms
#### 10. Embed privacy and security by design
