# Governance for Agile Teams

When the lab kicked off, there was no appropriate governance structures in place or recommended to support or protect teams. Everyone was learning how to "make Agile work." Over time, it has become evident that there is a need to adapt the typical governance structures connected to Agile teams in the public service, because they behave differently.

Governance needs to be very responsive to an Agile delivery team. Unlike typical public sector organizations where multiple priorities are common, members of Agile teams are ideally focused full-time on solving a problem. This focus affords them the ability to deliver and learn quickly. Any time spent waiting for a governance body to respond is extremely wasteful and risks team disengagement.

## Alliance team
In the last two years, Lab Operations has designed and tested a governance structure called an Alliance Team. The Health Gateway Team was the first to apply and learn from this structure.

**The problem this structure aims to solve is** that Ministries have multiple, uncoordinated departments that a team may need to liaise with to resolve blockers or get service. For example, the finance department, privacy and security officers, and a project management office. All of these agencies will likely be unfamiliar with Agile methods, and will waste the time of the team with misaligned expectations.

**The hypothesis is**:
- IF we create a small, nimble team that is oriented around the Product Owner and able to engage the Ministry to remove administrative barriers to provisioning the team with what they need,
- THEN the PO and Scrum Master can focus on the immediate needs of the team, the product, and people receiving the service;
- AND the Ministry agencies concerned with upholding standards and accountability for some element of service delivery, can have confidence the team will address material concerns*.

*NOTE that some concerns that apply to standard, waterfall projects are not material concerns for Agile Product delivery. Status reports, for example, are not relevant for teams who report in different ways, and in the open.

Below is an illustration of how an Alliance team operates to enable effective governance. Note the designation of an "Alliance Lead."

## Executive Sponsors
Members of Executive Leadership are responsible for allocating resources to teams, making strategic decisions to address Service Plan and Government Mandate commitments, and for organizational development.

These sponsors are engaged directly by the Product Owner and by the Alliance team lead.

- **Executive Director (ED):** Often coaches the PO to address to Ministry Division priorities and supports the PO to engage other Executive in the organization. Should also work to market the work of the team within and beyond the program division, and to direct staff to engage positively with the team.
- **Assistant Deputy Ministry (Program area):** Is accountable for the outcomes of the program the service product supports and for organization health. The ADM needs to champion the change a new Agile team is implementing, including to other executive in the Ministry.
-**Chief Financial Officer:** Should understand what the Agile team is aiming to achieve, and how risk and money is managed differently with an Agile approach, so they can support funding healthy teams that are meeting users' needs.
-**Chief Information Officer:** Partners with the program area ED and ADM to align or allocate IM/IT resources that may be needed to support product delivery and sustainment.
