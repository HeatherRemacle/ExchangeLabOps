As teams come to the lab, we are commonly asked: how do we set up governance for this thing?

Unlike typical public sector organizations where multiple priorities are common for a team, members of Agile teams are ideally focused full-time on solving a problem. This focus affords them the ability to deliver and learn quickly. Any time spent waiting for a governance body to respond is extremely wasteful and risks team disengagement.

**Governance structures need to be very responsive to the functions of Agile delivery.**

## Definition

In generic terms, Governance should be designed to enable the positive conditions you are aiming to achieve with a group of people that is appropriate for the context they are in.

Governance  represents the norms, values and rules of the game through which interactions and decision making are managed. It may be subtle and not be easily observable. In a broad sense, governance is about the culture and institutional environment in which stakeholders interact among themselves and participate in the affairs of the organization.

When the lab kicked off, there were no new governance structures in place or obvious ways to restructure existing governance. Everyone was learning how to "make Agile work." Or, they attempted to apply exsiting governance structures, with ill-effect.

Over time, it has become evident that there is a need to adapt the typical governance structures connected to Agile teams in the public service.

## What is wrong with typical governance?

When people in government think of governance, they often think of decision making committees. These structures are a product of hierarchy and actually reflect a process designed to slow public servants down. It includes deliberation and decision making at a table where people have limited attention and time. Where the circumstances (rules, conditions) are clear and simple enough for the table to understand, this structure can work.

A committee table is ill-equipped to make most decisions related to complex problems, which are the focus of Agile teams. They have the least information about the problem and potential solutions, and simply do not have the time or methods to properly probe, sense and respond with appropriate decisions.


## What is different about Agile Governance?

Agile organizations behave differently than traditional government structures, based on a different set of assumptions about what enables productivity, risk management, and accountability, given the context they are in.

**The context is very important:** not every program or problem should be addressed with Agile methods.

When programs come to the lab assuming they could benefit from support to become Agile, we first inspect their context. We use the Cyenfin Framework as a guide to determine if they are operating in complexity first.

Some key questions for how to design governance appropriate for agile organizations and teams would be:

- How do we ensure interactions enable maximum velocity for a product team, that is burning public funding full time on a focused problem?
- How do we enable decision making that leads to rapid learning and incremental delivery of working software over a period of weeks?
- How do we place those with overall accountability (senior leaders) in a position to have significant positive impact on the productivity of a team and the suitability of a product?


## Alliance team
In the last two years, Lab Operations has designed and tested a governance structure called an Alliance Team. The Health Gateway Team was the first to apply and learn from this structure.

**The problem this structure aims to solve is** that Ministries have multiple, uncoordinated departments that a team may need to liaise with to resolve blockers or get service. For example, the finance department, privacy and security officers, and a project management office. All of these agencies will likely be unfamiliar with Agile methods, and will waste the time of the team with misaligned expectations.

**The hypothesis is**:
- IF we create a small, nimble team that is oriented around the Product Owner and able to engage the Ministry to remove administrative barriers to provisioning the team with what they need,
- THEN the PO and Scrum Master can focus on the immediate needs of the team, the product, and people receiving the service;
- AND the Ministry agencies concerned with upholding standards and accountability for some element of service delivery, can have confidence the team will address material concerns*.

*NOTE that some concerns that apply to standard, waterfall projects are not material concerns for Agile Product delivery. Status reports, for example, are not relevant for teams who report in different ways, and in the open.

Below is an illustration of how an Alliance team operates to enable effective governance. Note the designation of an "Alliance Lead."

## Executive Sponsor Roles
Members of Executive Leadership are responsible for allocating resources to teams, making strategic decisions to address Service Plan and Government Mandate commitments, and for organizational development.

These sponsors are engaged directly by the Product Owner and by the Alliance team lead.

- **Executive Director (ED):** Often coaches the PO to address to Ministry Division priorities and supports the PO to engage other Executive in the organization. Should also work to market the work of the team within and beyond the program division, and to direct staff to engage positively with the team.
- **Assistant Deputy Ministry (Program area):** Is accountable for the outcomes of the program the service product supports and for organization health. The ADM needs to champion the change a new Agile team is implementing, including to other executive in the Ministry.
-**Chief Financial Officer:** Should understand what the Agile team is aiming to achieve, and how risk and money is managed differently with an Agile approach, so they can support funding healthy teams that are meeting users' needs.
-**Chief Information Officer:** Partners with the program area ED and ADM to align or allocate IM/IT resources that may be needed to support product delivery and sustainment.

Ultimately, if we are building Agile teams, we should be focused on how to help them get results. These teams are full-time and focused on solving for user’s needs and deliver value more quickly than traditional (waterfall) methods. They have a high burn rate on resources, but they manage risk in small increments, so they require quick feedback cycles. The governance needs to be equally responsive.

The second question assumes that an Agile team can work with a traditional governance structure. This might include multiple levels of approval designed to slow decision making. This governance design is effective where high levels of known risk require management across an enterprise. While this is a helpful and required structure for a variety of public sector functions, it is not effective for Agile teams.

Agile is appropriately applied when we are solving complex problems where risks to effective delivery are unknown until we receive feedback from end users.

High bureaucracy reflects low trust and slows down learning.
If your organization is seeking to deliver using agile methods, then we’d expect a focus on building high performing teams. These teams are empowered to manage their work in ways that shrink risks associated with decisions through iterative and incremental work. They require quick feedback loops for learning.

If you are trying to create these teams, you should be adjusting your governance model or executive leadership expectations and behaviours. Otherwise, your investment in the talent and delivery will not be optimized. You may also be at risk of creating an aversion to agile methods overall, as people new to this way of working may abandon it out of frustration without the right governance conditions.
